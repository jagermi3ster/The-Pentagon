<p>Before I made this html page for our stopwatch I had to look up some basic layouts for HTML stop watch pages. I took one of the designs and completely remodeled it making the begginning of our front end HTML page.</p>

<h1 id="what-still-needs-to-be-done">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-still-needs-to-be-done" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What still needs to be done</h1>
<p>Our timer is non-functional right now. I need help from one of our backends to make the code in javascript. I think I get the idea of what the code is gonna look like but I need to consult my scrum master.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We will definitely be adding more items on the pages so it doesn’t look so blank.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="what-i-learned">
<a class="anchor" href="#what-i-learned" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I learned</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I learned a lot about how the layout of the html page. I seems you build the pages top to bottom, or at least how I did it.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="problem-solving">
<a class="anchor" href="#problem-solving" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Problem Solving</h1>
<ul>
  <li>I was having a tuff time seeing what the html was going to look right or if I was even doing it right, so I was searching up programs to see if I could code and see it build at the same time. This is where I found liveweave which helped me build in html in real time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CSS Learning</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>I learned that different colors in CSS can be in a HEX form, RGB form or a HSL form. I then colored the different buttons and text. It was pretty straightforward with CSS, you call the ID and then can add different styles to each id. The way I spaced out everything was mostly with margins but I was having trouble with the title and bar below it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-3-problems">
<a class="anchor" href="#week-3-problems" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Week 3 Problems</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Our server went down on Tuesday, we got it fixed Wenesday. We also can not figure out how to play an alarm sound with a button using Javascript. It seems the audio files on google need the user to allow the sound to play, which means pressing the button. But we need our alarm to sound automatically after time has passed.</li>
