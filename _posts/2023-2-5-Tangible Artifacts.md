**Intentional or Purposeful bias (Crossover Group Up, 10 minutes)**
Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

- The average age of facebook users were 25-34 years old. For tiktok users an average age was 16-24 years old. I think the date is purposeful because the advertisements they have on each platform is skewed to the ages.
Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?

- The femakle voice has been known to be sounding as comforting, supportive, and trustworthy. I think it's good for business but I don't see how it could harmful.
Talk about an algorithm that influences your decisions, think about these companies (ie FAANG - Facebook, Amazon, Apple,Netflix, Google)

- These companies have a big control over your lives and actions. They provide an constant media into our brains with news and ads all over the pace. They give us media that is addictive that can consume our lives. They also give us resources that make our lives easier.

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- No I don't think he thought it was intentional, he didn't seem mad by the tone of the voice. He was kinda joking the whole time.
If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
How do you think this happened? 
- I think they use some sort of light tracking and they were picking up the light/reflection off of wanda's skin. 
Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- I don't think it was harmful if this was a mistake, it is was intentional then it would be harmful.
Should it be corrected?
- I think it should be corrected because it is completely unfair to people of darker skins buying the same products of people of fairer skin.
What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome
- I would create a different type of camera focusing software so it works with all different kinds of people.

**Obtaining Data via Crowdsourcing (Crossover Group Up, ~10 minutes)**
We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used.

- I have used a movie API, weather API, Amazon API, Stock API.
We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub?
- The biggest discovery I have found on github is that you can see commit history. Also Wgetting was another big discovery i have found this trimester.
Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting?

- I think that everything in this top 20 is seen in all the over FAANG companies and it shows that people listen to these resources.

**Summary** 

**5.3 Hacks**
- I think there is a ton of computer bias around the world. This was shown through the age ranges of different social media sites. We can see they target the audience that uses there platforms the most to try and raise revenue for there company. I also think technology is biases for people that have a little more money. They are able to afford the better and more useful technology giving them an advantage. I think we can avoid bias by making technology more accessable for everyone. If we allow more access I think we can eliminate media targetting groups. 

**5.4 Hacks**
Think of a use case for crowdsourcing in you project …

CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? 
- I think a good crowdsourcing idea could be a poll for all CS students to vote on assignments they want to learn. This way the majority could get the assignments they want to do, the only problem with this is the collegeboard standerds.
What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.

_ I think we could crowdsource at the N@TM by collecting the things of what people do. If similar ideas or code are a common thing in people projects I think these people would like to focus on that.

**Individual Contribution**

This week I have been trying to put up our backend server on aws. This week I have been following the steps in nighthawk coders trying to put up a server on aws. I connected to the instance and that part all running. 

- I then put our flask server with data into aws. The problem I have gotten into is creating docker in AWS.
