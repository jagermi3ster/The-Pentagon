Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit?
- One beneficial effect of our project is better physical health. Our project aims to better your lifestyle and especially your diet. Another beneficial effect is to help you get stronger with our search bar tool that allows you to see some tips and tricks. It also allows you to become more organized and on top of what you eat. We allow you to track your macros of everything you eat.
Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.

Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?
- I think some pros of having internet blockers is to block out inapropriote searches. I think some cons is that it doesn't allow some useful resources that could help better your learning. 
What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.
- I think a concern of mine is that some kids don't have tools that we have. If we don't provide tools to these children the gap will only continue to grow. The children in poor income communities will continue to struggle if they don't get access to these tools.

5.1 Issues:
