**Student 1**

Sample 1 Explanation: The student didn't complete the program fully, it was pretty short, and was only tested once. Didn't manage complexity at all. However they did test it and explained the algorithm in detail. And abstraction for both Procedural and Data abstraction, they went into a lot of detail about their code and what each of its functions were.

**Student 2**
Sample 2 Explanation: This student went very in-depth and explained everything in detail. It was tested and they managed their complexity, everything was done up to standards.

**Student 3**

This submission has showed a working functions with inputs and outputs. It has two main codes that are pretty complex. It demonstrates iteration and meets all criteria for the testing catagory. They explain it detailed enough so someone can recreate it, also describes the working parameters. Overall my score lined up with collegeboard pretty similar.

**Student 4**

Overall this student didn't do as well as the 3rd submission. he didn't manage his complexity very well with lists and didn't give examples of data abstraction with lists containing data.

**Reflection**:
- Overall my scores lined up pretty similar to what collegeboard did, I am beginning to see what they want me to do but I have to get better at managing complexity like what the 3rd submission did.
