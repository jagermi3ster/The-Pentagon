## Question 14
<img width="798" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 11 27 03 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/232870907-e62b836f-0fa5-45f1-bd05-0ff3eebe080a.png">
I got this question wrong. It was a question asking about the outputs of two different values. I thought that since the display came first on program A, it would result in more values being printed before i > 10. But because program b adds first before it checks for the new i value, they will still have the same amount of values printed, just the values would be off by 1 so the correct answer is C.


## Question 26
<img width="797" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 11 27 14 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/232871014-6adad540-0a14-4068-9b40-29638f099bde.png">
This question was about moving a robot to the grey square. I thought that C was the correct answer as I thought the robot would move forward until it couldn’t, then rotate right and everything would work. But I forgot to take into account that towards the end it could move straight when it should turn right. To combat this I should have chosen choice A where we first check if the robot can rotate right before we make it move forward.


## Question 30
<img width="797" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 11 27 25 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/232871179-a218804a-ac0f-47fc-839e-8478d55442ab.png">
I thought that since there were 4 genre lists that we would have to run the analysis four times, But if forgot to take into account the Analysis at the beginning of the segment where we ran it within science fiction, so the correct answer would be 5 hours which would match up with answer D.


## Question 32
<img width="797" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 11 27 41 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/232871356-bf8c6698-fbe0-4feb-8a8e-de44c8abd6a8.png">
I made a stupid mistake here, I thought an X meant no and a “o” meant yes, it was the other way around.


## Question 55
<img width="797" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-18 at 11 28 09 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/111550260/232871514-dbf65c41-6c42-48fb-925d-09ae1c80c03b.png">
Another mistake by me, I thought that we were trying to fix the code to make it produce true when the user typed “y” the correct answer is obviously D as the user cannot type both yes and y.


# Reflection
Overall, I think I did really well compared to other tests. I worked well with my whole team to really understand and go over each question. Some of the questions had Riggi and I stumped because of how long confusing the questions are. However, some of the coding questions we actually understood because working together with Riggi it was very easy to go through the code together and figure out either the problem or the output. I believe that I am starting to understand more and more about Computer Science. One thing I think I really struggle on though is having to select multiple answers in the question, as I find those questions to be more tricky and confusing for me. But overall I definitely see improvement from previous tests.
