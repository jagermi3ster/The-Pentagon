# Problems
Before I made this html page for our stopwatch I had to look up some basic layouts for HTML stop watch pages. I took one of the designs and completely remodeled it making the begginning of our front end HTML page. 

# What still needs to be done
Our timer is non-functional right now. I need help from one of our backends to make the code in javascript. I think I get the idea of what the code is gonna look like but I need to consult my scrum master. 

- We will definitely be adding more items on the pages so it doesn't look so blank.

# What I learned
- I learned a lot about how the layout of the html page. I seems you build the pages top to bottom, or at least how I did it. 

**CSS Learning**
- I learned that different colors in CSS can be in a HEX form, RGB form or a HSL form. I then colored the different buttons and text. It was pretty straightforward with CSS, you call the ID and then can add different styles to each id. The way I spaced out everything was mostly with margins but I was having trouble with the title and bar below it.
