## The Key Commands Everyone should know

`Clear` This key will get rid of all the junk you have already typed into your terminal/shell

`Cd` will put you into a directory/repo of your choice

` --version` will tell you the version of something you are using like python

`Conda List` Will allow you to see which Conda versions you have downloaded and the one you are currently using.
