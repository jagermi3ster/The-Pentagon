# Other people's projects
Looking at other people's projects really impressed me especially this Kahoot project below. They added animations and a live game which really impressed me.

# Fun experience
- It was cool to talk to other people about their experience in taking APCSP. I liked learning about others projects and their thought process on making it. The variety between people's interest around the classroom really impressed me, all of the functions of different projects was really cool.

# People were interested in our Project!
- It was cool to see to that people thought our project was useful. Hopefully someone can use our timer to efficiently complete their work. That was the main goal of our project; which was to help people. Hopefully everyone will complete the tasks they input to our system. 

- Hopefully with our website people can procrastinate less and get more work done. I was surprised how many people were there. The room was super packed and it was extremely loud. 

# Other Arts

Ceramics and D/P were really cool to look at. It was impressive how many people showed up for this event, it really showed the nighthawk pride.
