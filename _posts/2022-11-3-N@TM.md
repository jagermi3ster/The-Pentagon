# Other people's projects
Looking at other people's projects really impressed me especially this Kahoot project below. They added animations and a live game which really impressed me.

# Fun experience
- It was cool to talk to other people about their experience in taking APCSP. I liked learning about others projects and their thought process on making it. The variety between people's interest around the classroom really impressed me, all of the functions of different projects was really cool.
