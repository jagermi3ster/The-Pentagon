# This score was not achieved alone!
- Our whole table worked on this test together and this was why our score was so good. An interesting thing about this test were the functions. The functions were pretty useless in most situations or they overcomplecate it completely.

# The hard portions of the test

- The binary questions were quite difficult for me because I contained no prior knowledge to binary. I was being taught by drew and devon on how it worked. I still think I need to learn more on how it works because I forgot overnight. 

# The easier parts of the test

I would say the easier parts of the test were the loops and functions. It's what we were taught in class. The functions that were used like math were pretty easy to understand as well. The teamwork problems were also fairly simple and basic. They would be things we used in real life which isn't that hard to understand. The problems were real life situations that could used in a job, which I do have, in which I could get these teamwork questions right. 

# What I learned
I learned some functions during the test and learned wht is necessary and what isn't necessary. I learned a little bit about binary and how 0 in four bit is actually 0000 and 1 is 0001, then the ones keep shifting over in a way.

- Think some of the functions taught me the way code goes back and forth through the lines of code. 

- I think this test also taught me that organization in computer science is very important. I can get confusing when the lines get overcomplicated when it the code could be condensed.  

# Trimester Reflection

- What did I learn in this class? I think I actually did learn some things in this class unlike a lot of other classes in Del Norte. I think I learned some basics of python and some cool things in HTML/CSS. I learned what Github and VSCODE were, I also learned how some functions work. What I'm looking forward next tri is binary code, when I think of like a hacker I think of a lot of binary numbers on a screen. It also feels a little bit math related which I'm good at, so I think I could be decent on it.
