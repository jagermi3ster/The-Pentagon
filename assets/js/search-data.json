College Board talks about ideas like Tools. &quot;the ability to process data depends on users capabilities and their tools&quot; | Combining Data. &quot;combine county data sets&quot; | Status on Data&quot;determining the artist with the greatest attendance during a particular month&quot; | Data poses challenge. &quot;the need to clean data&quot;, &quot;incomplete data&quot; | . | . From Pandas Overview -- When working with tabular data, such as data stored in spreadsheets or databases, pandas is the right tool for you. pandas will help you to explore, clean, and process your data. In pandas, a data table is called a DataFrame. | . . &#39;&#39;&#39;Pandas is used to gather data sets through its DataFrames implementation&#39;&#39;&#39; import pandas as pd . Cleaning Data . When looking at a data set, check to see what data needs to be cleaned. Examples include: . Missing Data Points | Invalid Data | Inaccurate Data | . Run the following code to see what needs to be cleaned . df = pd.read_json(&#39;files/grade.json&#39;) print(df) # What part of the data set needs to be cleaned? # From PBL learning, what is a good time to clean data? Hint, remember Garbage in, Garbage out? . Extracting Info . Take a look at some features that the Pandas library has that extracts info from the dataset . DataFrame Extract Column . print(df[[&#39;GPA&#39;]]) print() #try two columns and remove the index from print statement print(df[[&#39;Student ID&#39;,&#39;GPA&#39;]].to_string(index=False)) . DataFrame Sort . print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;])) print() #sort the values in reverse order print(df.sort_values(by=[&#39;GPA&#39;], ascending=False)) . DataFrame Selection or Filter . print(df[df.GPA &gt; 3.00]) . DataFrame Selection Max and Min . print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.max()]) print() print(df[df.GPA == df.GPA.min()]) . Create your own DataFrame . Using Pandas allows you to create your own DataFrame in Python. . Python Dictionary to Pandas DataFrame . import pandas as pd #the data can be stored as a python dictionary dict = { &quot;calories&quot;: [420, 380, 390], &quot;duration&quot;: [50, 40, 45] } #stores the data in a data frame print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF&quot;) df = pd.DataFrame(dict) print(df) print(&quot;-Dict_to_DF_labels--&quot;) #or with the index argument, you can label rows. df = pd.DataFrame(dict, index = [&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day2&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;]) print(df) . Examine DataFrame Rows . print(&quot;-Examine Selected Rows&quot;) #use a list for multiple labels: print(df.loc[[&quot;day1&quot;, &quot;day3&quot;]]) #refer to the row index: print(&quot;--Examine Single Row--&quot;) print(df.loc[&quot;day1&quot;]) . Pandas DataFrame Information . print(df.info()) . Example of larger data set . Pandas can read CSV and many other types of files, run the following code to see more features with a larger data set . import pandas as pd #read csv and sort &#39;Duration&#39; largest to smallest df = pd.read_csv(&#39;files/data.csv&#39;).sort_values(by=[&#39;Duration&#39;], ascending=False) print(&quot;--Duration Top 10&quot;) print(df.head(10)) print(&quot;--Duration Bottom 10&quot;) print(df.tail(10)) .

It is a great dataset for learning how to manipulate and analyze large datasets using pandas. . | . | These are just a few examples of the many datasets that are suitable for learning pandas. The best dataset for you will depend on your interests and the specific skills you want to develop. . Follow up question, &quot;where can I find Titanic data set?&quot; . | The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning, and it can be found on various websites and data repositories. Here are a few places where you can find the Titanic dataset:- Kaggle: The Titanic dataset is available on Kaggle, which is a popular platform for data scientists and machine learning enthusiasts. You can download the dataset from the Kaggle website after creating an account. . UCI Machine Learning Repository: The Titanic dataset is also available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which is a collection of datasets that are commonly used for machine learning research. You can download the dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website. . | Seaborn library: If you have the Seaborn library installed in your Python environment, you can load the Titanic dataset directly from the library using the following code: . import seaborn as sns titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) . | . | . Titanic Data . Look at a sample of data. . import seaborn as sns # Load the titanic dataset titanic_data = sns.load_dataset(&#39;titanic&#39;) print(&quot;Titanic Data&quot;) print(titanic_data.columns) # titanic data set print(titanic_data[[&#39;survived&#39;,&#39;pclass&#39;, &#39;sex&#39;, &#39;age&#39;, &#39;sibsp&#39;, &#39;parch&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;fare&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;]]) # look at selected columns . Use Pandas to clean the data. Most analysis, like Machine Learning or even Pandas in general like data to be in standardized format. This is called &#39;Training&#39; or &#39;Cleaning&#39; data. . # Preprocess the data from sklearn.preprocessing import OneHotEncoder td = titanic_data td.drop([&#39;alive&#39;, &#39;who&#39;, &#39;adult_male&#39;, &#39;class&#39;, &#39;embark_town&#39;, &#39;deck&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) td[&#39;sex&#39;] = td[&#39;sex&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == &#39;male&#39; else 0) td[&#39;alone&#39;] = td[&#39;alone&#39;].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == True else 0) # Encode categorical variables enc = OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown=&#39;ignore&#39;) enc.fit(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]) onehot = enc.transform(td[[&#39;embarked&#39;]]).toarray() cols = [&#39;embarked_&#39; + val for val in enc.categories_[0]] td[cols] = pd.DataFrame(onehot) td.drop([&#39;embarked&#39;], axis=1, inplace=True) td.dropna(inplace=True) print(td) . The result of &#39;Training&#39; data is making it easier to analyze or make conclusions. In looking at the Titanic, as you clean you would probably want to make assumptions on likely chance of survival. . This would involve analyzing various factors (such as age, gender, class, etc.) that may have affected a person&#39;s chances of survival, and using that information to make predictions about whether an individual would have survived or not. . Data description:- Survival - Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes). Not included in test.csv file. - Pclass - Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd) . Name - Name | Sex - Sex | Age - Age | Sibsp - Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard | Parch - Number of Parents/Children Aboard | Ticket - Ticket Number | Fare - Passenger Fare | Cabin - Cabin | Embarked - Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton) | . | Perished Mean/Average . | . print(titanic_data.query(&quot;survived == 0&quot;).mean()) . Survived Mean/Average | . print(td.query(&quot;survived == 1&quot;).mean()) . Survived Max and Min Stats . print(td.query(&quot;survived == 1&quot;).max()) print(td.query(&quot;survived == 1&quot;).min()) . Machine Learning . From Tutorials Point%20is,a%20consistence%20interface%20in%20Python). Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.&gt; Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. Decision Trees, prediction by a piecewise constant approximation. - Logistic Regression, the probabilities describing the possible outcomes. | . | . from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score # Split arrays or matrices into random train and test subsets.

However, please note that Boolean quantities are restricted to a singlular bit (can only be either 1, or 0) . On the otherhand, binary numbers may be composed of many bits adding up in place-weighted form to any finite value, or size . Relational Operators in action . How could you use operators to determine if the average of 5 grades is greater than 80? . With the grades below, use a boolean expression to determine if the average grade is above an 80 and print the result (True or False) . Try it in as few steps as possible! Be creative! There are obviously TONS of different practical solution . grade1 = 90 grade2 = 65 grade3 = 60 grade4 = 75 grade5 = 95 grades = grade1 + grade2 + grade3 + grade4 + grade5 average = grades % 5 average &gt; 80 if average == 0: print(&quot;false&quot;) else: print(&quot;true&quot;) . false . Conditionals . Focusing on Selection Selection: uses a condition that evaluates to true or false . Selection determines which part of an algorithm are executed based on a condition being true or false . Algorithm is a finite set of instructions that accomplish a specific task .

I believe that having a resume that can be accessed online can be good to be shown so you can get a job. . Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication. . Good passwords are made up of a few key components including randomness, complexity and length. If your password is predictable, simple and or/short, chances are it is less secure. I think another step that can be used with 2FA is asking for security questions along with the text message they send you. | . Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption. . -Symmetric encryption uses a private key to encrypt and decrypt an encrypted email.

I think there is a ton of computer bias around the world. This was shown through the age ranges of different social media sites. We can see they target the audience that uses there platforms the most to try and raise revenue for there company. I also think technology is biases for people that have a little more money. They are able to afford the better and more useful technology giving them an advantage. I think we can avoid bias by making technology more accessable for everyone.

This way the majority could get the assignments they want to do, the only problem with this is the collegeboard standerds. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting?

Overall this student didn’t do as well as the 3rd submission. he didn’t manage his complexity very well with lists and didn’t give examples of data abstraction with lists containing data. . Reflection: . Overall my scores lined up pretty similar to what collegeboard did, I am beginning to see what they want me to do but I have to get better at managing complexity like what the 3rd submission did. | .",

Purpose: . The purpose of this lesson is to help students understand how to make an efficient program and optimize it and understand its importance to the CSP curriculum. . What is Algorithmic Efficiency? . The ability of an algorithm to solve a problem in an efficient way An efficient algorithm solves a problem ___ and with a _, such as time and memory. | . | How do we determine if an algorithm is efficient or not?

The purpose of this lesson is to introduce students to the concept of undecidable problems in computer science and to explain why these problems are important. . Key vocabulary: . Decision problem | Decidable problem | Undecidable problem | . Decision Problem . A decision problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics that can be solved by a yes-no answer, also known as a binary answer. In other words, a decision problem is a problem for which there are only two possible outputs:&quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. There are two types of decision problems that Collegeboard goes over: . Decidable Problems | Undecidable Problems | . A decidable is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which an algorithm can be created that can always produce a correct answer or solution. In other words, a decidable problem is a problem for which there exists an algorithm that can be used to determine whether a given input is a valid solution or not. . An undecidable problem is a problem in computer science and mathematics for which it is impossible to create an algorithm that can always provide a correct answer or solution. This means that it is not possible for an algorithm to always determine whether a given input is a valid solution to an undecidable problem. . Decidable Problems . A decidable problem is an algorithm that can always have an output of yes or no given any input. It is always correct. . Example of a Decidable Problem . The procedure below tests to see if a number is divisible by 13. If it is, it returns true. If it isn&#39;t, it returns false. . def divideThirteen(number): if number % 13 == 0: return True else: return False print(divideThirteen(26)) print(divideThirteen(30)) . True False . Undecidable Problems . An Example of a Forever Running Code . The code keeps adding 1 to the variable number until number is no longer an integer(This is not the python data type &quot;integer&quot;, it&#39;s the integer in number theory).

The Halting Problem . The halting problem is an example of an undecidable problem. It states that it is not always possible to correctly determine whether a code halts or runs forever. . There is no way to write an algorithm to analyze and determine whether a body of code can run forever or not. . Halting Problem Example: . HaltChecker analyzes the program, program P, and its input, input I. If program P halts with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;halts&quot;. If program P doesn&#39;t halt(runs forever) with input I, HaltChecker returns an output of &quot;never&quot;. For example, in the code where it tests if variable number, the code runs forever, so HaltChecker returns an output of “never”. . | Then, we add another algorithm called Reverser which reverses HaltChecker&#39;s output. So, if &quot;never&quot; is the output of HaltChecker, then the output of Reverser is “halts”. It&#39;s also the same the other way around: if HaltChecker has an output of &quot;halts&quot;, then Reverser has an output of “never”. . | We combine these algorithms into one entire body of code. . | Since Reverser is the algorithm at the end, hence giving the ultimate output, notice how it prints &quot;never&quot; when in fact there is an end(As proved by HaltChecker), and how it also prints &quot;halts&quot; when there is in fact is no end to the code(Also proved by HaltChecker). As a result, HaltChecker is inaccurate and this is an undecidable problem. . | . This Diagram Sums up the Entire Process in the Bulleted List: . Credits of diagram and example to Khan Academy . FAQ . Q: If Reverser is causing the problem, why not remove it? | A: Removing Reverser will remove the problems, however, we are looking for ways which create the problem of not outputting a correct result. One example is enough to prove that it is an undecidable problem since it proves that the code is not completely accurate. | . Extra Things to Notice . Note that while a computer may take a long time to run a section of code, it does not mean that the computer is going to run forever. | Humans are able to solve some undecidable problems. The entire Halting Problem example was to prove that computers cannot solve undecidable problems. | . Hacks . Come up with one situation in which a computer runs into an undecidable problem.

Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation . This code simulates the motion of the ball using the equations of motion for projectile motion. It starts the ball at the left field (x = 0), and simulates its motion by updating its position at each time step using the initial velocity components and the acceleration due to gravity. The loop continues until the ball reaches home plate (x &gt; 100), at which point the simulation stops and the final position of the ball is printed. It uses a physics equation to see where the ball will be thrown based on the angle and speed of the ball. . import math # Constants GRAVITY = 9.81 # acceleration due to gravity, in m/s^2 # Inputs angle = 45 # angle at which the ball is thrown, in degrees initial_speed = 30 # initial speed of the ball, in m/s # Conversion from degrees to radians angle_radians = angle * math.pi / 180 # Initial velocity components vx = initial_speed * math.cos(angle_radians) vy = initial_speed * math.sin(angle_radians) # Time step dt = 0.01 # time step, in seconds # Initial position (left field) x = 0 y = 0 # Simulation loop while True: # Update position x = x + vx * dt y = y + vy * dt vy = vy - GRAVITY * dt # Break the loop if the ball has reached home plate if x &gt; 100: break print(&quot;The ball landed at x =&quot;, x, &quot;and y =&quot;, y) .

Once it reaches the set destination, it will say that the man made it home after x amount of steps. . | For the 3D plane, it takes a lot longer due to how big and open the 3d environment is, so there are more if statements in the 3d plane . | . (explain further) . import random x = 0 y = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): step = random.randrange(4) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 turn = turn + 1 if x == 0 and y == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Man Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;)&quot;) if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average, &quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . import random x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = 0 turn = 0 stopped = 0 turns = [] while (nights &lt; 100): #rando movement step = random.randrange(6) if step == 0: x = x+1 if step == 1: x = x-1 if step == 2: y = y+1 if step == 3: y = y-1 if step == 4: z = z+1 if step == 5: z = z-1 #Turn counter turn = turn + 1 #Goal check if x == 0 and y == 0 and z == 0: nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;The Bird Has Made It Home After &quot;, turn, &quot;Turns&quot;) turns.append(turn) turn = 0 if turn/1000 % 1000 == 0 and x + y + z != 0: print(&quot;(&quot;, x,y, &quot;) &quot;,&quot;| &quot;, z) #Too long Stoper if (turn &gt; 10000000): stopped = stopped + 1 turn = 0 x = 0 y = 0 z = 0 nights = nights + 1 print(&quot;Caped&quot;) average = sum(turns) / len(turns) print(&quot;Avaerage&quot;, average,&quot;Ones that when&#39;t too long &quot;, stopped) . Simulations in the wild . Simulations are used extremely frequently in real life applications. One of the most common examples of simulations are video games. A games physics engine can accurately simulate objects colliding . Another example is Blender, the software used in 3d animations class, here at Del Norte. Blender is made up of many small simulations, but one big one it uses is simulating the way light bounces off of and interacts with objects. . HW !!! . Create a simulation. It can be anything, just has to simulate something. . Some ideas: . Two objects colliding | Gravity on other planets | . AND . Find an example of a simulation in a software/game you use, screenshot, and explain how it is a simulation .",

Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language. Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called. A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called. Slide 2: . When calling procedures, it&#39;s important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements. If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and input the arguments. If the procedure returns some sort of data like a value or boolean, then you will assign that value to a variable Slide 3: . Assume the Temperature outside is Fahrenheit. The procedure convertFahrenheit is intended to convert from Fahrenheit to Celsius. Convert the following psuedocode to python . def convertFahrenheit(temp): celcius = temp - 32 celcius = celcius * 5/9 return celcius outsideTemp = input(&quot;Insert Temperature&quot;) outsideTemp = (convertFahrenheit(int(outsideTemp))) print(outsideTemp) . -6.111111111111111 . Developing Procedures Slide 8: . Picking a descriptive name is important in case you revisit the code later on (separate words with capitals) There are 2 different types of procedures- ones that return a value and those that simply execute a block of statements Steps of developing procedure: picking a useful name, thinking of parameters (what data does the procedure need to know), making a flowchart or writing procedure in pseudocode, and actually developing the procedure. . Slide 9: . In this example, a teacher is writing a program that will replace the grade on a previous quiz if the new grade is better than the previous. . What would be a good name for this procedure?

Procedural Abstraction One type of abstraction is procedural abstraction which provides a name for a process and allows a procedure to be used only knowing what it does and not how it does it This is very helpful in managing complexity in a program Subdivision of a program into separate subprograms is called modularity A procedural abstraction may remove shared features to generalize functionality instead of duplicating code. This allows for program reuse, which helps manage complexity When a pre-written procedure is called, you don’t necessarily need to know the details of this, just what it does and how to call it Simply, procedural abstraction is naming and calling a prewritten procedure Making sure to include the right arguments so the procedure can do what its supposed to do is crucial Complexity Example One of the biggest advantages of procedural abstraction is managing complexity. .

            "content": ". This score was not achieved alone! . Our whole table worked on this test together and this was why our score was so good. An interesting thing about this test were the functions. The functions were pretty useless in most situations or they overcomplecate it completely. | . The hard portions of the test . . The binary questions were quite difficult for me because I contained no prior knowledge to binary. I was being taught by drew and devon on how it worked. I still think I need to learn more on how it works because I forgot overnight. | . The easier parts of the test . I would say the easier parts of the test were the loops and functions. It’s what we were taught in class. The functions that were used like math were pretty easy to understand as well. The teamwork problems were also fairly simple and basic. They would be things we used in real life which isn’t that hard to understand. The problems were real life situations that could used in a job, which I do have, in which I could get these teamwork questions right. . What I learned . I learned some functions during the test and learned wht is necessary and what isn’t necessary. I learned a little bit about binary and how 0 in four bit is actually 0000 and 1 is 0001, then the ones keep shifting over in a way. . Think some of the functions taught me the way code goes back and forth through the lines of code. . | I think this test also taught me that organization in computer science is very important. I can get confusing when the lines get overcomplicated when it the code could be condensed. . | . Trimester Reflection . What did I learn in this class? I think I actually did learn some things in this class unlike a lot of other classes in Del Norte. I think I learned some basics of python and some cool things in HTML/CSS. I learned what Github and VSCODE were, I also learned how some functions work. What I’m looking forward next tri is binary code, when I think of like a hacker I think of a lot of binary numbers on a screen. It also feels a little bit math related which I’m good at, so I think I could be decent on it. | .",

It was cool to see to that people thought our project was useful. Hopefully someone can use our timer to efficiently complete their work. That was the main goal of our project; which was to help people. Hopefully everyone will complete the tasks they input to our system. . | Hopefully with our website people can procrastinate less and get more work done. I was surprised how many people were there.

            "content": "Problems . Before I made this html page for our stopwatch I had to look up some basic layouts for HTML stop watch pages. I took one of the designs and completely remodeled it making the begginning of our front end HTML page. . What still needs to be done . Our timer is non-functional right now. I need help from one of our backends to make the code in javascript. I think I get the idea of what the code is gonna look like but I need to consult my scrum master. . We will definitely be adding more items on the pages so it doesn’t look so blank. | . What I learned . I learned a lot about how the layout of the html page. I seems you build the pages top to bottom, or at least how I did it. | . Problem Solving . I was having a tuff time seeing what the html was going to look right or if I was even doing it right, so I was searching up programs to see if I could code and see it build at the same time. This is where I found liveweave which helped me build in html in real time. | . CSS Learning . I learned that different colors in CSS can be in a HEX form, RGB form or a HSL form. I then colored the different buttons and text. It was pretty straightforward with CSS, you call the ID and then can add different styles to each id. The way I spaced out everything was mostly with margins but I was having trouble with the title and bar below it. | . Week 3 Problems . Our server went down on Tuesday, we got it fixed Wenesday. We also can not figure out how to play an alarm sound with a button using Javascript. It seems the audio files on google need the user to allow the sound to play, which means pressing the button. But we need our alarm to sound automatically after time has passed. | .",

Here I defined the players/coach and made a team function. . // define a student Array of Person(s) var players = [ new Person(&quot;Jagger&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Matthew&quot;, 2023), new Person(&quot;Gavin&quot;, 2024), ]; // define a team and build Team objects and json function Team(coach, players){ // 1 coach, many student // start Team with Coach coach.setRole(&quot;Coach&quot;); this.coach = coach; this.team = [coach]; // add each Student to Team this.players = players; this.players.forEach(student =&gt; { student.setRole(&quot;Student&quot;); this.team.push(student); }); // build json/string format of Team this.json = []; this.team.forEach(person =&gt; this.json.push(person.toJSON())); } // make a CompSci team from formerly defined coach and players compsci = new Team(coach, players); // output of Objects and JSON in CompSci team logItType(compsci.team); // constructed team object logItType(compsci.team[0].name); // abstract 1st objects name logItType(compsci.json[0]); // show json conversion of 1st object to string logItType(JSON.parse(compsci.json[0])); // show JSON.parse inverse of JSON.stringify . object ; [ Person { name: &#39;Kenji&#39;, classOf: 1970, role: &#39;Coach&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Jagger&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Matthew&#39;, classOf: 2023, role: &#39;Student&#39; }, Person { name: &#39;Gavin&#39;, classOf: 2024, role: &#39;Student&#39; } ] string ; Kenji string ; {&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Kenji&#34;,&#34;classOf&#34;:1970,&#34;role&#34;:&#34;Coach&#34;} object ; { name: &#39;Kenji&#39;, classOf: 1970, role: &#39;Coach&#39; } . Here I converted the json into HTMl and made a table out of that . // define an HTML conversion &quot;method&quot; associated with Team Team.prototype._toHtml = function() { // HTML Style is build using inline structure var style = ( &quot;display:inline-block;&quot; + &quot;border: 2px solid grey;&quot; + &quot;box-shadow: 0.8em 0.4em 0.4em grey;&quot; ); // HTML Body of Table is build as a series of concatenations (+=) var body = &quot;&quot;; // Heading for Array Columns body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Name&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Class Of&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;th&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&quot; + &quot;Role&quot; + &quot;&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;/tr&gt;&quot;; // Data of Array, iterate through each row of compsci.team for (var row of compsci.team) { // tr for each row, a new line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; // td for each column of data body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.name + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.classOf + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; body += &quot;&lt;td&gt;&quot; + row.role + &quot;&lt;/td&gt;&quot;; // tr to end line body += &quot;&lt;tr&gt;&quot;; } // Build and HTML fragment of div, table, table body return ( &quot;&lt;div style=&#39;&quot; + style + &quot;&#39;&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;table&gt;&quot; + body + &quot;&lt;/table&gt;&quot; + &quot;&lt;/div&gt;&quot; ); }; // IJavaScript HTML processor receive parameter of defined HTML fragment $$.html(compsci._toHtml()); .

            "content": "Here I start to list a dictionary that assigns keys according to a word. So for example my first key is First Name and the value is Jagger. To print out the list I used the function print (infodb) . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Jagger&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Klein&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 18 2204&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Residence&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jagger.klein@icloud.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;2020-Mazda3&quot;, &quot;2022-Ferrari&quot;, &quot;2003-Hyundai&quot;, &quot;2016-Audi A3&quot;, &quot;1969-Volvo&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Below I output the loop data by using the function print_data. But to use this you need a parameter that defines the data d_rec. The function of actually making the list is for_loop, to activate the data. . def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() . For loop output Jagger Klein Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 18 2204 Cars: 2020-Mazda3, 2022-Ferrari, 2003-Hyundai, 2016-Audi A3, 1969-Volvo . While_Loop generally does the same thing as above but recursive loop activates the function untill it fails. . def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output Jagger Klein Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 18 2204 Cars: 2020-Mazda3, 2022-Ferrari, 2003-Hyundai, 2016-Audi A3, 1969-Volvo . def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Recursive loop output Jagger Klein Residence: San Diego Birth Day: September 18 2204 Cars: 2020-Mazda3, 2022-Ferrari, 2003-Hyundai, 2016-Audi A3, 1969-Volvo .",

The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
