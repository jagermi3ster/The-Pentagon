Think of three beneficial effects of your projects based on 5.1 Unit?</p>
<ul>
  <li>One beneficial effect of our project is better physical health. Our project aims to better your lifestyle and especially your diet. Another beneficial effect is to help you get stronger with our search bar tool that allows you to see some tips and tricks. It also allows you to become more organized and on top of what you eat. We allow you to track your macros of everything you eat.
Think of a potential harmful effect of your project.</li>
  <li>A potential harmful effect of my project is becoming too obsessed with what you eat. Some people can care too much with what they eat and don’t allow themselves to feel good.
Answer with an opinion and learnings so far this year:  What are pros/cons on internet blockers at router and lack of admin password on lab machines at school?</li>
  <li>I think some pros of having internet blockers is to block out inapropriote searches. I think some cons is that it doesn’t allow some useful resources that could help better your learning. 
What concerns do you have personally about the digital divide?  For yourself or for others.</li>
  <li>I think a concern of mine is that some kids don’t have tools that we have. If we don’t provide tools to these children the gap will only continue to grow. The children in poor income communities will continue to struggle if they don’t get access to these tools.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.1 Issues</strong>:
Blog Post Reflection
Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some beneficial and harmful affects of computing is that people don’t think for themselves. With all these resoruces at hand people reply on computers for simple tasks resulting in them being lazy.</li>
  <li>Some beneficial affects is that some hard to find anwsers that can’t be done ourselves can be helped with resources like the internet.</li>
</ul>

<p>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Some issues with dopamine is that we have too much access to media like tiktok.  I think some things that are interferring with my sucess is forgetting everything I learn in hgihschool. Everything in Del Norte is quick learning for a grade. We don’t remember anyhting that was taguht to us.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>5.2 Issues</strong>
Blog Post Reflection – Digital Empowerment
How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone can empower themeselves in this new digital world by using all the resources presented to them. Using media to keep track of their bank, social media, and news, they can keep up with the fast moving world.
How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</li>
  <li>
    <p>People with access to the internet can help people who dont have access. Del Norte does this by giving everyone access to chromebooks.
Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</p>
  </li>
  <li>I wouldn’t say at DEl Norte or 4s because everyone is fortunate enough to have money to afford a chromebook. I would say people in lower income communites have a bigger dissadvantage</li>
</ul>
