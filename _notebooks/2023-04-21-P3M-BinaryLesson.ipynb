    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?\n",
    "- Digital is with a computer and analog is manual or doing it by yourself.\n",

    "#### 1b\n",
    "1. What is the largest number can be represented by 5 bits?\n",
    "- 31\n",
    "\n",
    "2. One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language?\n",
    "\n",
    "- First language can represent 2^16 and the seconds is 2^56. \n",

    "#### 1c\n",
    "1. What values can each digit of a Base 5 system represent?\n",
    "- 0 to 4\n",

    "- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E and F.\n",
    "3. When using a base above 10, letters can be used to represent numbers past 9. These letters start from A and continue onwards. For example, the decimal number 10 is represented by the letter A in Hexadecimal. What letter would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 in a Base 30 system? What about in a Base 50 system?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Base 30 system, the number 23 in Base 10 would be denoted by the letter H because in Base 10, H stands for the value 15 and Base 30 has 30 characters (0-9 and A-T). On the other hand, in a Base 50 system, the letter X would be used to represent the Base 10 number 23 because X represents the value 23 in Base 50.\n",
