    "-Overall I think we did really well on this quiz and it wouldnt have been possible without working together within our gorup. I think we learned some valuable information from this quiz and I don't think it was a complete waste of time. In general, I believe I performed well on the multiple choice quiz. Previously, it took me a longer time to comprehend the questions and determine the answers. However, on this quiz, I was able to understand most of the topics within a minute or two, even with multiple readings. I feel that I have gained more knowledge compared to my previous attempt, even though it may be considered basic. Prior to this quiz, I was discouraged about my progress and felt that I was not making any improvements. However, based on my results and the way I approached this quiz, I believe that I am making progress and on track in my APCSP studies.\n"
