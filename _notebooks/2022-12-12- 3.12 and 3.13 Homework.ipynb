    "A Procedure is a named group of programming instructions that may have parameters and return values.\n",
    "Procedures are referred to by different names, such as method or function, depending on the programing language.\n",
    "Parameters are input values of a procedure. Arguments specify the values of the parameters when procedure is called.\n",
    "A procedure call interrupts the sequential execution of statements causing the program to execute the statements within the procedure before continuing. One the last statement in the procedure (or a return statement) has executed, flow or control is returned to the point immediately following where the procedure was called.\n",
    "Slide 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "When calling procedures, it's important to take notice to whether it returns data, or a block of statements.\n",
    "If the procedure just returns a block of statements, you call the procedure by referring to the procedure name, and input the arguments.\n",
    "If the procedure returns some sort of data like a value or boolean, then you will assign that value to a variable\n",
